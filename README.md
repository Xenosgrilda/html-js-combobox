# Nice Little Combobox


This is a little project for a little and very simple ComboBox.
<br>
I was trying to find a way to customize the \<datalist> element and after spending some valuable time on it I just gave up and decided to create my own.
<br>
I tried to include it's basics functionalities and some customizable style, I apologize upfront about the mess, I wasn't planning to publish this, but since I could find very little about this subject on the internet I thought it would be nice to share.

Please, send me any feedback on it!
<br>
Enjoy!
